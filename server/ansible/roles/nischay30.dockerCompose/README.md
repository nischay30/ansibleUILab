Role Name
=========

Install docker-compose 



Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - { role: nischay30.dockerCompose, docker_compose_version: '1.9.0' }
